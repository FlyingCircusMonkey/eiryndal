# The Create A Village Challenge

## Each player (or other interested party?) will get to describe a small village somewhere in Eiryndal.

You'll need to provide:

- The name of the village. The village name can be anything you want, including, but not limited to:
  - name it after yourself
  - name it after a character you've played
  - name it after a pet, your favorite real-world historical figure, your favorite cousin?
  - any word(s) you want, including made up words.
  - If you make up a word, be prepared to pronounce it. In English.

- The village population
  - For the purposes of classification by size, villages in Eiryndal are limited to about 250 residents, so any size from abandoned (0) to "almost a town" (250)

- **Optional** Up to 2 current or past residents that can range from "known throughout the land" to "barely a local celebrity"
  - Fake bonus points for historic figures that are only rumored to have existed without verifiable records that certify their existance. 

- **Optional** 1 or 2 historic events or people that set the tone for how the village operates today or influence how it's percieved throughout the rest of Eiryndal
  - Same fake bonus points for events that folks aren't really positive happened, but that "everyone" agrees are "true"

- The village economy
  - Most villages are probably centered around 1 or 2 occupations for the residents.
  - This doesn't mean (for example) that if the village is primarily a farming village that's famous for it's potatoes, there _isn't_ a town blacksmith but should at least identify how most of the residents earn money.

- The current leader(s) of the village.
  - This can be a single person, such as an elected mayor, or a group such as an elected village council, or possibly the family that controls the town by virtue of their birthright and history. 

- You can provide as much, or as little description of how the village is governed as you like but you should provide (at a minimum)
  - Do the leaders govern with force or fear, or do they govern peacefully?
  - Are there specific laws within the village that outsiders should know about?
  - Do the residents pay taxes to support the local government?
    - If the residents don't pay taxes, how is local government funded?
  - How are outsiders/visitors to the village treated?
    - Is the village welcoming to outsiders?
    - Maybe they view visitors as suspcious?

- The village location, geography and weather(ish):
    - Is it in the mountains?
    - Maybe its a coastal village?
    - Perhaps its in a desert that has yet to be described in the history of Eiryndal
    - You can be specific about where in Eiryndal this village is located, with reasonable limits. IE: "Among the mountains on the eastern coast" but exact coordinates will likely be disregarded.
    - Does it snow there?
    - How harsh is Winter (if at all?)
    - Maybe it rains constantly, and everything is covered in moss or mold?

- Feel free to add in (again, within reason) details about what makes this village unique! I'll try to incorporate the details into the overall history of Eiryndal as much as possible.
